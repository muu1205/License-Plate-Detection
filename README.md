Reading License Plate from an image

In this Project, we are going to describe the usage and numerous advantages of license plate recognition in daily life.
It has a great scope, as it can be used in tollbooth for automated recognition of license plate using a simple photograph of that vehicle.
This automated recognition can be implemented in car parking, if any vehicle is violating traffic rules then photograph of that vehicle
will be taken and by using that photograph we can use our license plate
Recognition method can get the vehicle license plate information and then the concern authority can
search in their database and find out the defaulters.
There are considered an approach to identify vehicle through recognizing of it license plate using image fusion, neural networks
and threshold techniques as well as some experimental results to recognize the license plate successfully
It can also be used as payment of challan or toll via account through licence number.
